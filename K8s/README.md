    A script.sh (if applicable) that might be necessary to perform the task.
    A demonstration.pdf showing how to perform the task.

🚀 Tasks Overview

    1. Install and Setup EKS CLI for managing Kubernetes clusters on AWS : This guide walks through the installation of the EKS CLI (eksctl) and the creation of a Kubernetes cluster on AWS using the Amazon EKS service. It simplifies the management of Kubernetes clusters on AWS by using a set of easy commands to create, manage, and update clusters.

    2. Install and Setup Minikube on your system : This guide covers the installation and setup of Minikube on an Ubuntu system. Minikube allows you to run a single-node Kubernetes cluster locally, enabling developers to experiment with Kubernetes applications in a lightweight environment.

    3. Kubeadm Installation and Configuration : Kubeadm is a tool designed to simplify the process of setting up and managing Kubernetes clusters. It enables users to bootstrap a Kubernetes control plane, add worker nodes, and manage cluster configurations effectively.
     
**Note: More tasks will be added as we cover more Kubernetes use cases.**

**🛠 Prerequisites**

**Before you start working with the tasks, ensure you have:**

    Kubernetes installed on your system. (If not, follow the setup instructions in the setup_kubernetes.sh file on an Ubuntu system)
    Basic knowledge of kubectl commands (e.g., kubectl apply, kubectl get, kubectl describe).

**🔄 How to Run the Tasks**

    Navigate to the Task Folder:

  
    cd Kubernetes/Task-1/

**Read the Instructions: Open the README.md in the task folder and follow the steps.**

**Run the Scripts (if applicable): If the task includes a script (script.sh), you can run it:**

    ./script.sh

    Refer to the PDF: View the demonstration.pdf for a visual guide on how to complete the task.

**💡 Tips**

    Review the Kubernetes documentation if you're unfamiliar with certain commands. https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://kubernetes.io/docs/home/&ved=2ahUKEwjMkPS_kfKIAxVm1TgGHT_iECUQjBB6BAgNEAE&usg=AOvVaw1FO_GXBp5rq9qk5Obdh2g7
    Modify the scripts and YAML files as needed to experiment with different configurations.
    Use kubectl explain <resource> to get detailed information about Kubernetes resources and their fields.
